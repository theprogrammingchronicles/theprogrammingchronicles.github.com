  <h2>About</h2>
  <div class="block">
    <p>This is The Programming Chronicles source code GitHub repository. You can get here the source code of many projects, exercises and examples published on <a href="http://theprogrammingchronicles.com/">The  Programming Chronicles Blog</a>.</p>
    <p>The Programming Chronicles is a common and typical blog where you can find articles about software development subjects, such as coding, design, architecture, software engineering, and so on. </p>
    <p>The Internet is full of blogs like this one and we cannot really say this one has something exceptionally remarkable, unless you discover an article that attracts your attention in an unexpected and interesting way.</p>
    <p>The common factor could be the special interest that the author shows about agile software engineering subjects, such as TDD, ATDD, BDD, Scrum and Extreme Programming in general.</p>
    <p>In fact, our proudly achievement in terms of code so far might be the TDD exercises package of the TDD course.</p>
    <p><strong>Note: </strong>I'm sorry the blog is in Spanish, when I decide to write in English I'll let you know.</p>
