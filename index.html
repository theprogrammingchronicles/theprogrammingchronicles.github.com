  <h2>About</h2>
  <div class="block">
    <p>This is The Programming Chronicles source code GitHub repository. You can get here the source code of  projects, exercises and examples published on <a href="http://theprogrammingchronicles.com/">The  Programming Chronicles Blog</a>.</p>
    <p>The Programming Chronicles is the usual and typical blog where you can find articles about software development, with topics such as coding, design, architecture, software engineering, and so on. </p>
    <p>The Internet is full of blogs like this one and I cannot really say this one has something exceptionally remarkable, unless you discover an article that attracts your attention in an unexpected and interesting way.</p>
    <p>The common factor might be the special interest that the author shows about agile software engineering subjects such as TDD, ATDD, BDD, Scrum and Extreme Programming in general.</p>
    <blockquote>
    I'm sorry, the blog is written in Spanish, <strong>when I decide to write in
    English I'll let  you know</strong> - I expect it could be soon.</blockquote>
