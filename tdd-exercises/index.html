      The exercises are coded in Java, but I think it would be easy to migrate to other languages. I've tried to
      use basic JDK elements and avoid to use any particular framework or library, except for the unit testing 
      and mocking libraries.</p>
      
      <p>The unit tests are written with <strong>JUnit 4.0</strong> and the automatic mocking with 
      <strong>Mockito</strong>. Even so there are some exercises that show you how to make unit
      tests or mocks without any framework or library help such JUnit or Mockito.</p>
      
      <p>The build system is <strong>Maven 2</strong> and all the projects generate a lot of useful
         information with <code>mvn site</code> command.</p>

      <p>
      The most of the exercises are about the implementation of an application called <b>WikiAddressbook</b>. 
      I have planned to publish information and notes about this imaginary application. In short you can think 
      of it as an application to manage a global address book where anonymous people can create, edit, update 
      and delete contacts. Everyone in the world can contribute to create the content of the bigger address book
      of the world through the magic of Web 2.0 Collective Intelligence.</p>
        
      <p>
      The exercises are organized in several lessons and appendix. Every lesson has its own readme file
      where you can look for the goals of the lesson. Each lesson is divided in several projects that 
      shows individual steps of the incremental and iterative process of TDD. Some steps show very little 
      increments, so they are micro-steps such as the implementation of a very little new behaviour, a 
      very little refactor after getting a green light and so on. Other exercises show how the code 
      look likes after several iterations of the TDD process.</p>

         
      <p>
      There are some lessons or exercises that do not have anything to do with the WikiAddressbook application.
      They are isolated exercises showing an important an specific concept of the <strong>TDD methodology
      </strong>.</p>    
      
      <blockquote>
      I'm so sorry. All the source code is written using English for identifiers, but
      the readme files and JavaDoc comments - that have important information like a tutorial - are written
      in Spanish.<br/>
      <b>Would you like to translate them to English? Or translate from Java to any other programming language?</b>
         Just fork me on GitHub.</blockquote>

      <p>
      All the projects, both lessons and exercises, are prepared to generate a <strong>maven site</strong> full
      of information. The readme files have the intentions and solutions of the exercises and lessons. The 
      functional and test source code is full of JavaDoc and non JavaDoc comments that explain in detail 
      different aspects of the TDD methodology, hits, tips, and so on.</p>
      
      <p>You can see here the maven site <a href="http://theprogrammingchronicles.github.com/tpc-tdd-exercises/">
         documentation</a>.</p>
      
      <blockquote>
      I have planned to generate an index with all that information to quickly locate the exercises that show 
      specific concepts of the methodology. <br/>
      And again I'm so sorry, the documentation is still in Spanish.
