      The exercises are written in Java, but I think it would be easy to migrate
        to other languages. I tried to use basic JDK elements and avoid using
        any particular framework or library, except for the unit testing and mocking
        libraries.</p>
      
      <p>The unit tests are written with <strong>JUnit 4.0</strong> and the automatic mocking with 
      <strong>Mockito</strong>. Even so there are some exercises that show you how to make unit
      tests or mocks without any framework or library such JUnit or Mockito.</p>
      
      <p>The automatic build is made using <strong>Maven 2</strong> and all the projects
        generate a lot of useful information - like a tutorial - with the <code>mvn
        site</code> command.</p>

      Most of the exercises are about the implementation of an application called <b>AddressbookWiki</b>.
       I'll  publish the description of  this imaginary
      application as soon as possible. In short, you can think of it as an application
      to manage a global address book where anonymous people can create, modify,
      delete and read contacts. Everyone around the world can contribute to create
      the content of the biggest address book of the world through the magic of Web
      2.0 Collective Intelligence.</p>
        
      <p>
      The exercises are organized in several lessons and appendixes. Every lesson
        has its own readme file where you can look for the goals of the lesson. Each
        lesson is divided in several projects that  shows individual steps of the
        incremental and iterative process of TDD. Some steps show very little  increments,
        so they are micro-steps such as the implementation of a very little new behaviour,
        a  very little refactoring after getting a green light and so on. Other steps
        show how the code  look likes after several iterations of the TDD process.</p>

         
      <p>
      There are some lessons or exercises that do not have anything to do with the AddressbookWiki application.
      They are isolated exercises showing an important an specific concept of the <strong>TDD methodology
      </strong>.</p>    
      
      <blockquote>
      <p>I'm so sorry, although all <strong>source code is written in English</strong>,
        the readme files and JavaDoc comments are written in Spanish, and they have
        important information like a tutorial.</p>
      <p><b>Would you like to translate them to English?</b> Just fork me on GitHub.

      All the projects - both lessons and exercises - are prepared to generate a <strong>maven
      site</strong> full
      of useful information. The readme files describe the intentions and solutions
      of the exercises and lessons. The functional source code and test source code
      are full of JavaDoc and non JavaDoc comments that explain different
      aspects of the TDD methodology  in detail, the way TDD works, some hits and
      tips, and so on.</p>
      
      <p>You can see here the full <a href="http://theprogrammingchronicles.github.com/tpc-tdd-exercises/">
         documentation</a></p>
      
      <blockquote>
      <p>I have planned to generate an index with all that information to quickly
        locate the exercises that show specific concepts of the methodology, but
        the documentation is still in Spanish. </p>
